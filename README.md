# Bannerlord.ChatGPT
ChatGPT API is added to the game. You could talk to the villagers, companions, and lords freely. The ChatGPT will read your input sentence and start the conversation with you.

This mod should be relatively clean without any interaction with other mods. Currently, it is tested in game version 1.2.8. In principle, this mod should also work for other. versions. If you have tried this mod with another version of the game and it works without any issues. I would really appreciate it if you could report that in the discussion.

If you encounter any problem in this mod. Please check the log.txt in ${Gamefolder}/Modules/Bannerlord.ChatGPT/ModReplay/log.txt file. It should contain the problems you encounter by using this mod.
Any bugs or issues reports are welcome. You could report here or on the GitHub page. Please include the log.txt file I mentioned previously. 

If you also want to contribute to the mod, you could visit this mod's GitHub page and start a pull request.

## Some issues
1. This mod is only valid in the mission view. For example, you could chat in the castles, inside the towns. However, any conversation started from the map won't be able to call this mod. This issue will be fixed in the later version.
1. Sometimes the response will be so long. The text is divided into several pages. You could left/right click your mouse to move to the next/previous page.
1. This mod is supposed to support most of the versions and have the minimum modification of the original game. However, they are not tested.
